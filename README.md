# PacketSniff
A simple packet sniffer for my laptop that i made in Python
**note** The packet sniffer has been made for my system specifically, meaning the file paths and the ip address in the code is system specific
as said, this is a very basic packet sniffer. Although, it will sniff packets regardless of if they are IPv4 TCP packets or not.
if you wish to implement the code, make the necessary changes in the aforementioned fields
